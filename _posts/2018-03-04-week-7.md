## What did you do this past week?

This week was dominated by the exam, work and getting caught up in my Linear Algebra class in preparation for an exam this week. My team met and discussed what we need to do for part 2 and I think it's going to be pretty manageable. I've been working on getting the water ski team's running order together for our upcoming tournaments as well.

I attended the Atlassian talk and really enjoyed it. I'd like to stay in Austin post graduation and it's good to see various options for companies that are either based here or have large offices locally.

As a bit of fun right after the exam Thursday I picked up a used pair of speakers that are older than I am. I got them for an unbelievably good price considering they were hundreds of dollars each when they were new in the 90s and are working flawlessly. I got the whole stereo setup completed that night and have been blown away by the quality of music they produce while I've been listening over the weekend.

## What's in your way?

Nothing at the moment except for the annoying lack of 30 hours in a day.

## What will you do next week?

* Study for and take the two midterms I have this week
* Work
* Finish up our ULM diagrams for the database
* Finalize the last details for my spring break plans

## What's my experience of the class?

I thought the exam was very fair. I'll avoid discussing the specifics here as Dr Downing mentioned some people had to take makeup exams but it covered more or less what I expected it to. The only things that tripped me up and almost led to me running out of time was thought I forgot a few little "tricks" that were necessary for solving a couple of the problems and it took me a long while to recall them. However, I was able to implement answers for all the questions that passed every test and (I think) met all the requirements that were listed along with each problem. I'm excited to see my grade for the exam!

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Keeping up with the stereo trend I'll run through some helpful things I found.

First, speaker placement is super important with regard to where you sit. This diagram shows it pretty well.

Second, if you're a Spotify Premium subscriber (it's only $5/month for students) there's a setting on both the desktop and mobile apps that will let you stream at a higher bitrate meaning the music will be less compressed and have a higher overall quality that's noticeable on good speakers or headphones. Some people prefer lossless music through a service like Tidal but I've done blind tests on myself and I can't hear a difference between a 320kb/s lossy song (Spotify's high quality option) and a lossless FLAC file at all.
