## What did you like the least about the class?

I think my largest frustrations were centered around ambiguity. There were many parts of the projects where it wasn't totally clear exactly what was expected of us in terms of both our implementation and end goal. However we got good grades when we did what we thought was right and put in good effort and the course staff were always available to answer questions. But especially in the first couple of projects that coupled with long turnaround times to receive project grades made for a difficult time knowing how to meet expectations. I'm not sure if there's a great fix to this though, because I really enjoyed how much freedom we were given with regards to our projects.

## What did you like the most about the class?

I really liked that we used modern and relevant tools and learned about interesting topics related to software engineering - which is a career myself and many of my peers are planning on going into. I'm not sure how many people did all the readings, but I found a lot of them to be really good and helpful information for a career in technology. One thing I would have liked better was if there was a way to expose everyone in the class to *all* of the technology in a large capacity. I ended up doing a lot of backend code which was fun and I learned a good bit, but it was something I already had a lot of familiarity with. Because other people on our team were already good at react I didn't end up writing much of the frontend code and I think it would have been valuable to have covered those technologies in lecture some to fill those gaps.

## What's the most significant thing you learned?

This was by far the most teamwork intensive class I've taken in college, including operating systems. Working with a 5 other people without any management structure and all of us having busy schedules was something that I learned a lot from. We all got better at communicating and collaborating as the semester progressed and that's something I'm proud of.

## How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?

On average probably 3-5.

## How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?

Roughly 2-4 depending on the week.

## How many lines of code do you think you wrote?

I haven't looked at github but I'd imagine a couple thousand, perhaps less. Many of the frameworks and libraries vastly reduced the amount of code required.

## What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?

I had barely used postman before and none of its advanced features and I was blown away by how useful it was.

## What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?

`Flask-Restless` and leveraging Flasks's blueprint features both made our code very clean and made developing the API remarkably easy.

## If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?

I think the biggest improvement to the experience of the course would be tailoring the lectures to be a little more closely related to the technologies being used in the projects.
