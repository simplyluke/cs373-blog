## What did you do this past week?

This week went pretty well, but was exhausting. I was very busy studying for my chemistry and linear algebra midterms Wednesday and Thursday but they both went extremely well. I haven't seen a grade for the linear algebra exam yet, but I'd be shocked if it was low as I was very well prepared and didn't find any of the questions to be surprising or challenging. I also got my grade back for our exam in this class and was pleased to have done well on it as well.

Our group reviewed the feedback from our first IDB project and have adjusted some things about our part two to hopefully improve upon the feedback and get top marks. I feel that we're making good progress and should be able to wrap things up neatly after spring break. I'm planning on using a lot of my long car trip tomorrow to knock out our UML diagrams. The two big things we needed to do for this phase are moving to a database and refactoring our React approach and Steven got the lion's share of the database work done this week and there are clear plans for the rest.

I was also quite busy with water ski team related work. I've made our running orders for our spring tournaments and started working with skiers on setting goals for improvement so that we will be competitive enough to qualify for nationals in the fall. Today I spent a huge amount of time and effort working on the last stages of some repairs and maintenance for our jump ramp. It involved using a small lift to reattach a metal side curtain that probably weighed around 1,000lbs to the main ramp that we had pulled into the mud on the side of the lake. It took about 6 of us around 5 hours of hard work to get it done, and involved a lot of careful placement of straps, hammering, lifting, planning, and team work to get it all reattached to the several hinges the curtain is attached with. In short - I'm ready to be in an air conditioned room writing some code.

## What's in your way?

Nothing - spring break is going to be a welcome break.

## What will you do next week?

* Do some light studying and complete our UML diagrams
* Relax and not worry about school for a week

## What's my experience of the class?

I was a big fan of the ethics lecture this week and really wish I could have taken the class while it was still being taught here at UT! I'm excited that we've got a clear path to finishing up IDB2 before the deadline as well.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

A great tool for collaborating remotely with your teammates is [Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/). It allows two (or more) people to collaborate on the same documents within a text editor (atom is the one that's officially supported but I believe they've made it extensible to other editors). It's really useful for pair programming remotely without having to do something awkward like a remote desktop or other cumbersome solutions. Think of it like google docs for code. It's helpful to still use something like Slack's call feature or google hangouts to be able to talk through what you're doing while you're in the same code.
